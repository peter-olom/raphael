## Why Another Observability Tool?

Most observability stacks optimize for production scale and configurability. When you are debugging locally (or iterating with an AI agent), that often turns into too many screens, too many knobs, and too much cognitive overhead.

Raphael is intentionally designed for speed and clarity: a fast path from "something is broken" to the specific traces and wide events that explain it.
